        <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
        <p>First we need to learn some basic HTML</p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>This is how you make an unordered list :</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
            <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
            <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
